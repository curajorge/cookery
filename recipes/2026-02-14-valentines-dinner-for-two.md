## Course 1 — Tuna Tartare with Soy-Yuzu-Ginger Sauce

### Tartare

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Sushi-grade ahi tuna | 150g | Fish counter, confirm sushi-grade |
| Shallot | 10g | Minced as fine as possible |
| Chives | 3g | Finely sliced |
| Toasted sesame oil | 3g | Into the tartare mix (just a whisper) |
| Flaky sea salt | 0.5g | Maldon, to finish on top |

Dice tuna into clean 5mm cubes. Keep on ice until plating. Gently fold in shallot, chives, sesame oil. Don't mash — you want distinct cubes.

### The Sauce

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Low-sodium soy sauce | 15g | San-J or Kikkoman |
| Yuzu juice | 10g | Asian aisle (small bottle) — if unavailable, fresh lime juice |
| Rice vinegar | 8g | Seasoned is fine |
| Fresh ginger | 5g | Microplane-grated, squeeze through fingers — juice only, discard fiber |
| Toasted sesame oil | 5g | |
| Honey | 3g | Just a touch to round the acid |
| Neutral oil | 10g | Avocado oil — gives body and gloss |

Whisk everything together. Should taste bright, savory, slightly sweet, aromatic. Pools beautifully on a plate — glossy, restaurant-level.

### Base & Garnish

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Avocado (ripe) | 1 small (≈80g flesh) | Thin slices or small dice as a bed |
| Toasted sesame seeds (white + black mix) | 3g | Dry pan, 1 min |
| Microgreens | 5g | Any mix from produce section |

### Plating

1. Pool half the sauce on each plate (spoon it, let it spread naturally)
2. Fan avocado slices in the center (or small mound of diced avocado)
3. Ring mold or freehand the tuna on top of the avocado
4. Drizzle remaining sauce around/on top
5. Sesame seeds, microgreens, flaky salt to finish

## Course 2 — Fresh Pasta Carbonara (Tonnarelli)

### Fresh Pasta Dough

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 00 flour (Tipo 00) | 200g | Caputo "Chef's Flour" (red bag) |
| Whole eggs | 2 (≈100g) | Room temp |
| Egg yolks | 1 (≈17g) | Extra yolk = richer, more golden |
| Fine salt | 2g | Into the dough |
| Semolina or extra flour | 30g | For dusting cut pasta |

**Technique (stand mixer):**
1. Flour + salt in mixer bowl, paddle attachment
2. Eggs + yolk in the well, mix on low until shaggy (1–2 min)
3. Switch to dough hook, knead on medium-low 8–10 min until smooth, elastic, springs back when poked
4. Wrap tight in plastic, rest 30 min minimum at room temp — gluten must relax or it fights you when rolling
5. Flour surface generously, roll with pin to ≈2mm thick — rotate the sheet, don't stretch it
6. Lightly flour the sheet, fold loosely, cut 2–3mm strips for tonnarelli (or wider for fettuccine)
7. Toss cut pasta in semolina to prevent sticking, nest loosely on a tray

### Carbonara

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Fresh pasta (from above) | All of it | |
| Guanciale | 100g | Deli counter — if unavailable, pancetta (not bacon) |
| Pecorino Romano DOP | 60g | Finely grate on Microplane right before use |
| Egg yolks | 4 (≈68g) | Large eggs, room temp |
| Whole egg | 1 (≈50g) | Room temp |
| Black peppercorns | 5g | Coarsely crack in mortar or towel+pan — NOT pre-ground |
| Kosher salt (for pasta water) | 30g | For 3L water (1% by weight) |
| Water for pasta | 3000g (3L) | Less water = starchier water = better emulsion |

**Technique:**
1. Render guanciale from cold pan, medium-low, 8–10 min until glassy/crispy
2. Crack pepper into the guanciale fat (blooms the piperine)
3. Mix egg yolks + whole egg + grated Pecorino + cracked pepper in a bowl
4. Cook fresh pasta 2–3 min only (it's fresh, not dried)
5. Reserve 150g pasta water before draining
6. Pasta into guanciale pan OFF HEAT
7. Add egg/cheese mixture + 60–80g pasta water, toss vigorously
8. Residual heat cooks the egg to 65–70°C (silky, not scrambled)

**Critical:** No cream. Ever. The sauce is egg yolk + cheese + pasta water, emulsified by heat control.

## Course 3 — Dry-Aged NY Strip, Butter Basted

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Dry-aged NY strip | 450–500g | Whole Foods dry-aged section |
| Unsalted butter | 30g | For basting |
| Garlic | 2 cloves (≈10g) | Smashed, skin on |
| Fresh thyme | 3–4 sprigs (≈3g) | For butter baste |
| Kosher salt | 6g | Salt 45 min before cooking (or right before — not in between) |
| Black pepper | 2g | After searing, not before (pepper burns at high heat) |
| Neutral oil | 10g | Avocado or grapeseed, for initial sear |

**Technique:**
- Pat completely dry
- Salt 45 min ahead on a rack (or right before — never 5–30 min, draws moisture without time to reabsorb)
- Screaming hot cast iron + neutral oil
- Sear 3–4 min/side
- Add butter + garlic + thyme, tilt pan, baste continuously 1–2 min
- Pull at 5–10°F below target (carryover will finish it)
- Rest on rack minimum 5 min, loosely tented

## Course 4 — Arugula Salad with Lemon Vinaigrette

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Baby arugula | 80g | Washed, dried completely (spinner or towels) |
| Parmigiano-Reggiano | 30g | Shaved with peeler, not grated |
| Pine nuts | 20g | Toast in dry pan 2–3 min until golden, watch closely |
| Extra virgin olive oil | 25g (≈2 Tbsp) | Good quality, fruity not bitter |
| Fresh lemon juice | 15g (≈1 Tbsp) | About half a lemon |
| Dijon mustard | 5g (≈1 tsp) | Emulsifier + flavor |
| Flaky sea salt | 1g | Maldon or similar, to finish |
| Black pepper | 0.5g | Fresh cracked |

**Vinaigrette:** Whisk lemon + mustard + olive oil. Toss arugula. Top with Parm shavings + toasted pine nuts.

**Why this salad:** Peppery arugula cuts the richness of both steak and carbonara. Lemon vinaigrette provides acid contrast — the meal's biggest gap otherwise (very fat/umami-heavy). Shaved Parm echoes Pecorino without repeating it. Pine nuts add texture against all the soft/silky elements.
