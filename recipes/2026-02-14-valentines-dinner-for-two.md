**Status:** Planning

## Course 1 — Fresh Pasta Carbonara (Tonnarelli)

### Fresh Pasta Dough

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 00 flour (Tipo 00) | 200g | Caputo "Chef's Flour" (red bag) |
| Whole eggs | 2 (≈100g) | Room temp |
| Egg yolks | 1 (≈17g) | Extra yolk = richer, more golden |
| Fine salt | 2g | Into the dough |
| Semolina or extra flour | 30g | For dusting cut pasta |

**Technique (stand mixer):**
1. Flour + salt in mixer bowl, paddle attachment
2. Eggs + yolk in the well, mix on low until shaggy (1–2 min)
3. Switch to dough hook, knead on medium-low 8–10 min until smooth, elastic, springs back when poked
4. Wrap tight in plastic, rest 30 min minimum at room temp — gluten must relax or it fights you when rolling
5. Flour surface generously, roll with pin to ≈2mm thick — rotate the sheet, don't stretch it
6. Lightly flour the sheet, fold loosely, cut 2–3mm strips for tonnarelli (or wider for fettuccine)
7. Toss cut pasta in semolina to prevent sticking, nest loosely on a tray

### Carbonara

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Fresh pasta (from above) | All of it | |
| Guanciale | 100g | Deli counter — if unavailable, pancetta (not bacon) |
| Pecorino Romano DOP | 60g | Finely grate on Microplane right before use |
| Egg yolks | 4 (≈68g) | Large eggs, room temp |
| Whole egg | 1 (≈50g) | Room temp |
| Black peppercorns | 5g | Coarsely crack in mortar or towel+pan — NOT pre-ground |
| Kosher salt (for pasta water) | 30g | For 3L water (1% by weight) |
| Water for pasta | 3000g (3L) | Less water = starchier water = better emulsion |

**Technique:**
1. Render guanciale from cold pan, medium-low, 8–10 min until glassy/crispy
2. Crack pepper into the guanciale fat (blooms the piperine)
3. Mix egg yolks + whole egg + grated Pecorino + cracked pepper in a bowl
4. Cook fresh pasta 2–3 min only (it's fresh, not dried)
5. Reserve 150g pasta water before draining
6. Pasta into guanciale pan OFF HEAT
7. Add egg/cheese mixture + 60–80g pasta water, toss vigorously
8. Residual heat cooks the egg to 65–70°C (silky, not scrambled)

**Critical:** No cream. Ever. The sauce is egg yolk + cheese + pasta water, emulsified by heat control.

## Course 2 — Dry-Aged NY Strip, Reverse Sear (Our Place Oven Pro)

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Dry-aged NY strip | 620g | Thick cut — perfect for reverse sear |
| Unsalted butter | 30g | For basting during sear |
| Garlic | 2 cloves (≈10g) | Smashed, skin on |
| Fresh thyme | 3–4 sprigs (≈3g) | For butter baste |
| Kosher salt | 6g | Salt 45 min before cooking (or right before — not in between) |
| Black pepper | 2g | After searing, not before (pepper burns at high heat) |
| Neutral oil | 10g | Avocado or grapeseed, for final sear |

### Reverse Sear Method — Our Place Oven Pro

**Phase 1: Low oven (sous vide–style)**

1. Pat steak completely dry with paper towels — surface moisture is the enemy of Maillard later
2. Salt 45 min ahead, place on wire rack uncovered (or right before — never 5–30 min, draws moisture without time to reabsorb)
3. Set **Our Place Oven Pro → Bake → 200°F** — the Pro goes down to 80°F, but 200°F is the sweet spot: low enough for edge-to-edge even doneness, high enough to stay food-safe
4. Place steak on the oven's wire rack over the tray (elevated = air circulation on all sides, no hot spot on the bottom)
5. Insert probe thermometer through the thickest part, cable out the door
6. **No flipping needed** — the countertop oven surrounds with even heat, unlike a full-size oven with hot spots
7. Cook until probe reads **120°F internal** — estimated **45–55 min** for a thick 620g strip at 200°F. Start checking at 35 min
8. Remove steak, rest uncovered on a rack for **5 min** — surface dries further, carryover is minimal (~2–3°F) because the oven temp was so low

**Phase 2: The sear**

9. While steak rests, heat cast iron to **screaming hot** — high heat, 2–3 min with neutral oil just below smoke point
10. Sear **45–60 seconds per side** — that's all you need, the dry surface from the oven phase browns instantly (Lopez-Alt's whole point: reverse sear = better crust because less surface moisture)
11. Add butter + garlic + thyme, tilt pan, **baste continuously 30–45 seconds**
12. Transfer to cutting board, rest **5 min loosely tented**
13. **Final internal: ~130–135°F (medium)** — the sear adds 10–15°F to your 120°F pull temp

**Why reverse sear > traditional for this steak:** A thick 620g strip seared traditionally would have a grey band of overcooked meat ½ inch deep before hitting the pink center. Reverse sear gives you edge-to-edge even pink with a paper-thin crust. The low oven also activates cathepsins (tenderizing enzymes) that denature above 122°F — you're riding that window the entire cook.

## Course 3 — Arugula Salad with Lemon Vinaigrette

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Baby arugula | 80g | Washed, dried completely (spinner or towels) |
| Parmigiano-Reggiano | 30g | Shaved with peeler, not grated |
| Pine nuts | 20g | Toast in dry pan 2–3 min until golden, watch closely |
| Extra virgin olive oil | 25g (≈2 Tbsp) | Good quality, fruity not bitter |
| Fresh lemon juice | 15g (≈1 Tbsp) | About half a lemon |
| Dijon mustard | 5g (≈1 tsp) | Emulsifier + flavor |
| Diamond Crystal kosher salt | 1g (¼ tsp) | Dissolves into vinaigrette |
| Flaky sea salt | 1g | Maldon or similar, to finish |
| Black pepper | 0.5g | Fresh cracked |

**Vinaigrette:** Whisk lemon + mustard + 1g kosher salt until salt dissolves, then stream in olive oil. Season arugula needs salt before acid or it wilts unevenly. Toss greens, finish with flaky salt, Parm shavings + toasted pine nuts.

**Why this salad:** Peppery arugula cuts the richness of both steak and carbonara. Lemon vinaigrette provides acid contrast — the meal's biggest gap otherwise (very fat/umami-heavy). Shaved Parm echoes Pecorino without repeating it. Pine nuts add texture against all the soft/silky elements.
