## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Egg whites | 5 (~150g) | Leftover from carbonara + pasta dough — room temp |
| Caster sugar | 250g | Finer crystal dissolves faster — still add gradually |
| Cornstarch | 7g (~1 Tbsp) | Absorbs internal moisture, keeps center marshmallowy |
| White vinegar | 5g (~1 tsp) | Acid denatures protein more gently — soft center, crisp shell |
| Vanilla extract | 5g (~1 tsp) | |
| Diamond Crystal kosher salt | 1g (¼ tsp) | Loosens proteins so they whip faster |

### Topping

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Heavy cream | 120g | Cold — whips better |
| Caster sugar | 10g | Just enough to stabilize |
| Fresh berries | 150g | Strawberries, raspberries, or mixed — whatever looks best |

## Method

1. **Oven Pro → 250°F.** Line the tray with parchment. Draw two 13cm (5 in) circles on the parchment as guides, flip paper pencil-side down.

2. **Whip whites + salt on medium speed until foamy** — about 1 min. Whites should be opaque, no liquid pooling at the bottom.

3. **Increase to high, add sugar 1–2 Tbsp at a time.** Wait 10–15 sec between additions. This takes **5–7 min total** — less sugar + caster's finer crystals means you reach stiff glossy peaks faster. The sugar dissolves into the protein matrix, increasing viscosity and stabilizing the foam (Corriher).

4. **Test for doneness:** rub a small amount between your fingers. **No grit = ready.** Peaks should be stiff, glossy, and hold their shape when you lift the whisk.

5. **Fold in cornstarch + vinegar + vanilla** with a spatula — 3–4 gentle strokes, don't deflate. The cornstarch and acid are the pavlova secret: they create the crisp-outside, marshmallow-inside contrast.

6. **Divide onto parchment** — spoon half the meringue onto each circle. Build up the edges with the back of a spoon, push the center down to form a nest. Edges should be about 6–7cm tall.

7. **Bake at 250°F for 55–60 min** in the Oven Pro. The shell should be dry to the touch, very pale (slight ivory is fine, any browning means too hot). Small cracks on top are normal and desirable.

8. **Turn off the Oven Pro. Crack the door slightly. Leave pavlovas inside for 30+ min** — the slow cool prevents collapse. No rush; they can sit in the off oven for hours.

9. **Whip cream + 10g sugar to soft peaks** right before serving — 2 min by hand, 30 sec with a mixer. Do not over-whip.

10. **Top each nest** with whipped cream, pile berries on top. Serve immediately — pavlova softens within 1–2 hours once topped.

## Quick Rationale

Five leftover whites from the Valentine's dinner at a 1:1.67 white-to-sugar ratio (150g:250g) — less sweet than the classic 1:2 but still enough sugar to stabilize the foam and crisp the shell. The Oven Pro at 250°F is ideal: its small cavity delivers even, gentle heat that dries the shell without browning, and the 200–250°F range keeps you well below Maillard territory (~300°F) so the meringue stays white. Cornstarch + acid is the Pavlova technique (vs. plain French meringue) — it gives you that signature crisp shell that shatters into a soft, marshmallowy center.

## Notes & Adjustments

- **Timing with dinner:** Bake these before starting the steak. While they cool in the off oven, pull them out, start the steak at 200°F in the same Oven Pro. Pavlovas hold at room temp for 8+ hours untopped.
- **No cream of tartar needed** — the vinegar serves the same acidic stabilization role.
- **Bowl must be spotless** — any trace of fat (from yolks, butter residue, oily towel) prevents whites from foaming. Wipe bowl and whisk with vinegar on a paper towel first if unsure.
