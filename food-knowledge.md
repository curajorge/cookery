# Food Science & Recipe R&D — Context Dump

High-signal reference for LLM-assisted recipe generation. Organized by category; each entry names the book, why it matters for recipe R&D, and the specific chapter-level topics to extract. Feed this into context before asking for recipes — it activates the model's deep knowledge of these sources and produces Michelin-caliber output instead of generic "add salt to taste" recipes.

## Key operational principles (across all categories)

1. **Salt by weight, not volume** — 1% salt by weight of protein for seasoning; 2–3% for dry brine; 3–6% for wet brine. Measure with a scale. Diamond Crystal kosher ≈ half the density of table salt by volume.
2. **Dry surfaces brown** — Maillard reaction requires surface temp >300°F/150°C. Moisture = steam = no browning. Pat dry, salt early (draws and reabsorbs moisture), air-dry in fridge for best results.
3. **Carryover is real** — Pull proteins 5–10°F below target internal temp. Rest on a rack. Bigger mass = more carryover.
4. **Acid is the most underused tool** — A squeeze of lemon or splash of vinegar at the end fixes 80% of "something's missing" dishes. Taste, then add acid before adding more salt.
5. **Temperature > time for proteins** — Use a thermometer. "Cook 6 minutes per side" is unreliable. Internal temp is the only accurate doneness indicator.
6. **Pasta water is liquid gold** — Starchy pasta water (1% salt by weight) emulsifies cheese sauces, loosens ragù, and binds everything. Reserve it before draining. Always finish pasta in the sauce pan with a splash.
7. **Toast your spices** — Blooming spices in fat or dry-toasting them activates volatile compounds. 30–60 seconds in a dry pan or first step in hot oil. Whole spices before ground.
8. **Rest your dough** — Gluten needs time to relax. 30 min minimum for pasta, 20 min for pie crust. Cold rest for butter-based doughs (keeps fat solid = flaky layers).
9. **Taste constantly, adjust at every stage** — Season the water, season the protein, season the sauce, taste the final plate. Each layer compounds. Under-seasoning at one stage can't be fixed by over-seasoning at the next.
10. **Mise en place is not optional** — Weigh and prep every ingredient before heat is applied. Professional kitchens do this because it prevents errors, not because it's fancy. For home cooking it's even more critical because you can't call for backup.
